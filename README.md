# This repository includes files for the code used in developing weekly projects for ME35 in the Spring 2022 semester at Tufts University.

Each project was developed over the course of a week. We were given base guidelines for each robot's functionality, and extra features which could be included. For documentation about each project, visit [the robotics page on my portfolio](https://meganjenney.wixsite.com/portfolio/robotics)
