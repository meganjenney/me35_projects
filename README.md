# ME35 Projects #
This repository includes information and code developed during projects for the Intro to Robotics & Mechatronics course in the Spring 2022 semester (Fa22-ME-0035-01) at Tufts University.

## Course Overview ##
Each project was developed over the course of a week, given both base functionality guidelines and extra features which could be included.

Documentation for each project can be found at [the robotics page on my portfolio](https://meganjenney.wixsite.com/portfolio/robotics). Please [email me](mailto:meganjenney22@gmail.com) to request site password.

## SPIKE Prime Python Notebooks ##
The majority of weekly projects were developed using the LEGO SPIKE Prime education kit, which features the SPIKE Prime Hub. The Hub is controlled through Python scripts uploaded from the SPIKE Education App.

The folders for projects 1-3 and project 6 include one of each of the following:
- **.llsp files:** Python script, openable with the SPIKE App.
- **README.md:** Brief summary of project; copy of most recent Python code.

## Final Project ##
All students in the course collaborated in the development of a cake making robot. The folder included in this repository contains initial phases of development for image processing. For more on the final project, please visit [my robotics final project repository](https://github.com/meganjenney/roboticsFinalProject-Frosting).
